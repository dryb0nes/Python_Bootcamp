Number Guessing Game

1. print the art to the screen "Guess The Number"
2. print "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!"
3. print "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100."
    a. The game logic here should take and choose a random number betwee 1 and 100 and store it in a variable.
4. Choose a Difficulty: Type 'easy' or 'hard': 
    a. The input from this question will determine how many guesses the user will get
    b. The logic shold take the input and compare it to pre-defined values for 'easy' and 'hard' and assign the corresponding value to a variable detailing how many "guesses" the player gets
5. Once Difficulty is chose, define how many guesses they have to get the correct number.
    a. We will lookup the "guesses" variable defined in step 4.b.
6. Take and input with "Make a Guess:" as the prompt text
    a. this input should be compared against the value defined in 3.agains
    b. if the input does not match, the guess count should decrese by 1
        i. the guess should be compared against the current number to guess and if the value was "lower" then we should print "Too low".
        ii. if the current number to guess was "higher" then we should print "Too High"
    c. The user should then be prompted to "guess again" looping back to the top of step 6. and printing the number of "guesses" left.
    d. If the input matches the current number to guess then we should print "You got it! The answer was {current number to guess}"
