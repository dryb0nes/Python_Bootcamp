# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

# e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

    # this for loop interates through a range starting at 2, up to the square root of the input number.
    # the math.isqrt() function is used as it improves the efficiany slightly by creating a smaller pool of numbers to test.
    # the .isqrt() is used specifically because it automatically rounds down to the nearest whole integer to the square root of the input number. 
    # the "+ 1" is used to include the square of the number in the testing.
