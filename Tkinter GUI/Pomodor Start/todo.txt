use the "reps" variable to count down the correct number of seconds.
the program timer needs to switch between counting down the work time and then break time
1 rep = 25min work 5min break
every 4 reps the break should be 20 minutes

start timer
initiate the count_down function with the WORK_MIN
then after work min has completed start break with SHORT_BREAK_MIN
after short break need to increment reps by 1
if reps > 4
next break should be LONG_BREAK_MIN
then the timer should stop
